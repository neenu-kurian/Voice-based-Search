### Voice-based-Search

A simple voice search app created using plain javascript and webspeech api

If you speak "mobile" it gives you list of all mobiles. If you speak "android" it gives you list of all android phones.
If you speak "iphone" it gives you all iphones.

This is done to improve my skills on webspeech api.

### Steps to open the app

Download or clone the repo and open index.html
